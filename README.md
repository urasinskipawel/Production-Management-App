## General Information <a name="general-information"/> ‚ÑπÔ∏è

A project was created to practice technologies such as Express JS, TypeScript and SQL. My inspiration to create this application was to solve the problem of production planning in my current job which is done in multiple spreadsheets.

The entire application is divided into individual sections. The home page presents the main idea and purpose of the application. The support section is a kind of tutorial and familiarizes the user with the possibilities of the application. The next section is the admin panel which is intended for supervisors. It enables easy production management by adding employees, assigning tasks to them and updating individual stages of the technological process of a given task. The last section is an individual panel for each employee that was created in the administration panel. In this way, each worker can easily report his work

## Ideas & Improvements <a name="ideas-improvements"/> üöÄ

Currently, the application is at the stage of a working prototype that can be used.
I am gradually implementing improvements and fixing bugs.

The first improvement I'm going to implement is the ability to assign multiple tasks to one worker. It will allow planning work more dynamically. I'm also going to improve application error handling, which will simplify program maintenance

I am open to contact, suggestions and cooperation. If you have any ideas or encounter a problem, please email me at: uraspawel@gmail.com
